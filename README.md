This repo contains the latest versions of Phantomjs for Linux.

This repo should not be used for development. Instead it can be used as
hosting of phantomjs.
This is specially useful if your deployment/CI is already depending on
github.com. Better host this file also in github.com to avoid any extra
dependencies.
